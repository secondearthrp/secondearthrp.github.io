			<h1><i class="fas fa-flag"></i> Designing a Good Country Flag</h1>
			<p>
				Countries in Second Earth are based on real countries, and thus by
				default, have the same flag as their real-world counterparts. You may,
				however, choose to design your own flag.
			</p>
			<p>
				You do not need to read a vexillogy book from cover to cover, but there
				are some guidelines you should follow to create a recognisable and
				clean-looking flag.
			</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Keep your flag minimal</h3>
			<p>
				Your flag should be easy to recognise at small sizes, and so should not
				rely on intricate details. If your flag can not be roughly drawn or
				described from memory, you might need to rethink your design.
			</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Remember your history</h3>
			<p>
				Good flags reflect the history of what they represent, and they seldom
				change majorly between interations. As such, if you're making a custom
				flag, you might want to take inspiration and design elements from the
				original flag so that it remains recognisable.
			</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Think carefully about your colours</h3>
			<p>
				Take your time to think about the colours you use in your flag and their
				semantics. Here is a list of some of the most common colours, and their
				connotations:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Red</b>: war, blood, courage</li>
				<li><b>White</b>: peace, purity</li>
				<li><b>Blue</b>: liberty, justice, patriotism</li>
				<li><b>Yellow/Gold</b>: wealth, glory, sunlight</li>
				<li><b>Green</b>: nature, peace, fertility</li>
				<li><b>Black</b>: darkness, chaos, anarchy</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Purple and pink are almost never used in flags. In the past, the
				pigments of these colours were expensive and hard to come by, which is
				why purple is often used to represent royalty.
			</p>
			<p>
				Most flags do not use more than two or three main colours, and seldom
				have more than five colours in total.
			</p>
			<p>
				We also recommend picking the colours out of Discord's flag emojis to
				ensure that we can match them as closely as possible when we create the
				custom emojis.
			</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Do not use text in your flag</h3>
			<p>
				Do not use any text in your flag. Some real-word flags do have small
				amounts of text, but it is hard to read and replicate when we create the
				custom flag emojis, so we recommend not including it.
			</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Match other flags' ratios</h3>
			<p>
				Take a look at the size of other world flags. Most are rectangular and
				wider than they are tall. Make sure yours is rectangular and can fit
				into the footprint of other flags.
			</p>
			<p>
				As cool as Nepal's flag is, it's very difficult to match with custom
				emojis, so we ask that all flags be rectangular.
