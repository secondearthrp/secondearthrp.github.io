		<h1>Second Earth <span class="blue">Rules & Guidelines</span>.</h1>

		<p>
			First, thank you for taking the time to read the server guidelines. These
			rules have been put in place for good reason, and encourage every member
			of the server to have a positive experience in both the RP, and the server
			itself.
		</p>
		<p>
			Please keep in mind that every incident is dealt with on a case-by-case
			basis, and not necessarily by concrete rules.
		</p>

			<h2 id="server-guidelines">
				<i class="fas fa-user-group"></i> Server Guidelines
			</h2>
			<p>
				These rules are in relation to the server itself. These rules apply in
				<b>all channels</b>, both roleplay and out-of-character.
			</p>

			<ol>
				<li>
					<b><i class="fas fa-heart"></i> Treat others with respect.</b>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>Keep discussions and roleplay civil.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>
								Bullying and harassment is never welcome, and is taken very
								seriously.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>
								Discrimination of any kind is not tolerated. Hate speech and
								slurs will be filtered and result in a ban.
							</p>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>

				<li>
					<b
						><i class="fas fa-circle-exclamation"></i> No explicit NSFW
						content.</b
					>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>
								This includes pornographic, violent, gory, or otherwise explicit
								content.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>This covers all types of media (video, text, images, etc.).</p>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>

				<li>
					<b
						><i class="fas fa-comment"></i> No unwarranted spam or
						advertising.</b
					>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>
								Unnecessary or irrelevant advertising for any external source or
								server is treated as spam.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>This includes messages, reactions and @mentions.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>
								DM advertising is prohibited by Discord's Terms of Service, and
								will therefore result in a ban from the server. Please report
								any members who violate this rule.
							</p>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>

				<li>
					<b><i class="fas fa-address-card"></i> No impersonation.</b>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>
								Please do not impersonate, act as, or pretend to be any other
								server member, even if given permission by that member.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>
								This goes for all users, including members, bots, staff members
								and Timekeeper.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>
								This also applies to Tupperbox: do not use Tupperbox to pretend
								to be someone else, nor pretend to be someone else's Tupperbox
								OC.
							</p>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>

				<li>
					<b
						><i class="fas fa-message"></i> Please only speak English in all
						channels.</b
					>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>
								Phrases in other languages are allowed, provided they are both
								relevant and easy to understand in context (e.g. "Vivre la
								France", "Presidente d'Italia").
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>
								If you must speak in another language, please provide an
								accurate English translation in, before or after the message.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>
								English is the easiest language for us to moderate, and is also
								the language the vast majority of our members speak.
							</p>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>

				<li>
					<b
						><i class="fab fa-discord"></i> Follow Discord's
						<a
							href="https://discord.com/terms"

							target="_blank"
							>Terms of Service</a
						>
						and
						<a
							href="https://discord.com/guidelines"
							rel="noopener noreferrer"
							target="_blank"
							>Community Guidelines</a
						>.</b
					>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>
								This should go without saying, but you must follow Discord's
								rules and guidelines at all times.

			<h2 id="rp-guidelines">
				<i class="fas fa-theater-masks"></i> Roleplay Guidelines
			</h2>
			<p>
				These rules are in relation to roleplay. These rules apply in roleplay
				channels and scenarios.
			</p>

			<ol start="7">
				<li>
					<b><i class="fas fa-bolt"></i> No godmoding.</b>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>
								Do not make your characters invulnerable, omnipotent or
								otherwise overpowered.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>
								Your OC should not be able to know information that is not
								already disclosed or known to them.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>
								Each of your OCs are independent. One OC may know something that
								another does not.
							</p>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>

				<li>
					<b><i class="fas fa-ghost"></i> No powerplaying.</b>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>
								Powerplaying is the act of controlling or making another
								person's character do something.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>You may only control your own characters.</p>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>

				<li>
					<b><i class="fas fa-hand-fist"></i> No real-world geopolitics.</b>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>
								Try to avoid recreating real-world political events (the
								Ukraine-Russia war, the Israeli-Gaza war, etc.).
							</p>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>

				<li>
					<b
						><i class="fas fa-gavel"></i> No real-world extremist ideologies or
						organisations.</b
					>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>
								Avoid recreating real-world extremist ideologies or
								organisations (Nazism, ISIS, etc.).
							</p>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>

				<li>
					<b><i class="fas fa-video"></i> No NSFW scenes.</b>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>
								Implied "intimacy" is allowed, but explicit details are not. If
								your RP somehow comes to this, fade to black (e.g. "the pair
								entered the room and close the door firmly behind them...").
							</p>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>

				<li>
					<b
						><i class="fas fa-infinity"></i> Do not play
						<a
							href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Sue"
							rel="noopener noreferrer"
							target="_blank"
							>Mary Sue or Gary Stu</a
						>.</b
					>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>
								Mary Sue (or Gary Stu) are character archetypes that have
								unbound strengths and no weaknesses.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>
								Every character's strengths and weaknesses must be relatively
								balanced.
							</p>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>

				<li>
					<b
						><i class="fas fa-skull"></i> Do not kill or permanently harm other
						people's characters without consent.</b
					>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>
								You are only allowed to kill off, disable or disfigure an OC if
								it is either your own or you have permission from the OC's owner
								to do so.
							</p>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>

				<li>
					<b
						><i class="fas fa-lightbulb"></i> Include as much detail in your RP
						as possible.</b
					>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>
								Aim to make your RP message about a paragraph long. Brief
								interactions can be kept to a sentence or so; about 10 to 20
								words is okay.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>
								We put a lot of effort into building this fictional world, and
								it can be difficult to build off and reply to one-liner
								messages.
							</p>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>

				<li>
					<b
						><i class="fas fa-radiation"></i> Weapons of mass destruction are
						given only under very special circumstances.</b
					>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>
								Biological and nuclear weapons must be approved by a member of
								staff, and only used on a small scale for good reason.
							</p>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>

				<li>
					<b
						><i class="fas fa-theater-masks"></i> Roleplay channels are for
						roleplay only.</b
					>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>
								When typing in a roleplay channel, you must stay in character.
								There is an out-of-character (OOC) channel you can use to
								discuss roleplays. Otherwise, use the general channel.
							</p>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>

				<li>
					<b><i class="fas fa-robot"></i> No AI-generated roleplay.</b>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>
								We ask that you do not use AI-generated text in your roleplay.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>
								You may use AI for inspiration to help plan and phrase your
								roleplay, but please do not use raw AI-generated text.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>
								AI-generated images and OC avatars are permitted, as long as you
								remain honest and open about it.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>
								It is extremely easy to tell when content is synthetic, and so
								we ask that you don't attempt to lie about it. There is no
								reason to do so, nor is there any shame in having to use
								AI-generated imagery.
							</p>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>

				<li>
					<b
						><i class="fas fa-apple-whole"></i> No violating the laws of
						physics.</b
					>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>
								The server might be sci-fi, but we want to keep things
								relatively within the realm of possibility.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>
								This includes but is not limited to infinite energy systems and
								perpetual motion machines.
							</p>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
