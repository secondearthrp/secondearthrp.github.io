										<p>Can I use AI-generated content?</p>
										<ul>
											<li>
												You're welcome to use AI-generated images as your OC's
												avatar in Second Earth, but please be honest and open
												about this, and don't claim AI-generated images (or
												anyone else's, for that matter) as your own artwork, or
												try to earn money from them.
											</li>
											<li>
												Although strongly discouraged, you can use AI-generated
												text to help you plan and phrase your roleplay speech
												and actions, but again, please be transparent with us
												about it if you do, and try not to rely on it too
												heavily.
											</li>
											<li>
												AI should be used as a tool; a walking stick rather than
												a wheelchair. We can almost certainly tell when a robot
												has written text or generated images.

												<p>What are nation alliances?</p>
												<ul>
													<li>
														A nation alliance is a group of two or more nations
														affiliated with one another.
													</li>
													<li>
														Members of an alliance might share resources, or
														offer each other military and/or financial help in
														wars or after disasters.
													</li>
												</ul>
											</li>

											<li class="expandable collapsed">
												<p>How are nation alliances formed?</p>
												<ul>
													<li>
														Nation alliances are formed in the #diplomacy
														channel, usually in a thread.
													</li>
													<li>
														Alliances are usually organised by world leaders or
														other high-ranking members of the government, who
														may then make a statement in the #leader-statements
														channel.

								<ul>
									<li class="expandable collapsed">
										<p>What warrants a leader statement?</p>
										<ul>
											<li>
												World leaders will usually make speeches and
												announcements in response to world events, like wars,
												alliance formations and natural disasters.
											</li>
											<li>
												Leader statements are generally long-form posts, often
												include an attached image, and are often frequent in
												nature, much like statements from real-life world
												leaders.
											</li>
										</ul>
									</li>

									<li class="expandable collapsed">
										<p>Where are leader statements made?</p>
										<ul>
											<li>

								<p>What time is it on Second Earth?</p>

										The server time can be viewed on the
										<a href="clock" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"
											>clock</a
										>
										page.
									</li>
								</ul>
							</li>

							<li class="expandable collapsed">
								<p>How does time on Second Earth work?</p>
								<ul>
									<li>
										Time in Second Earth is based on the real Unix time,
										starting on March 10, 2124, and progresses about 4 times
										faster than real time.
									</li>
									<li>
										This means that one real-life week is approximately one
										Second Earth month, and one real-life second is a little
										over four Second Earth seconds.

									<li>
										You can unlock a number of neat perks by Boosting Second
										Earth. You get a hoisted Booster role and a custom colour
										role, permission to add an emoji of your choice, and you get
										to help out with testing shiny new features.
									</li>
									<li>
										To avoid making things pay-to-win, Boosting our server will
										not provide you any advantages in the RP.
